Trial 3: The Flag
====================
As a block element, the natural behavior of the div is to stack on top of other block elements. We'll abuse this behavior to create a German flag.

Expected tags
-------------
* html
* head
* style
* body
* div (3)

Style notes
-----------
* The top bar is black
* The middle bar is red
* The bottom bar is 'gold', defined as #ffd700

Layout notes
------------
* Each of the bars is the same thickness
* The width of the flag is 500px
* The width-to-height ratio of the flag is 5 to 3.
