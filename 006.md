Trial 6: Mixing and mixing
=========================
We're doing basically the same thing as before, but this time, everything is horizontal.

Expected tags
-------------
* html
* head
* style
* body
* div (6)

Expected css styles
-------------------
* display: inline-block
* margin-top
* margin-left

Style notes
-----------
* The left bar is red
* The right bar is blue
* The inner boxes are black

Layout notes
------------
* The two vertically stacked bars are 400x200 px
* The inner boxes are all 100x100 px
* The inner boxes are evenly spaced from the edges of the outer boxes
* **Important** in our screenshot, there is no gap between the left and the right bar. Figure out how to do this. (Hint: this is not a CSS problem)
