Trial 8: A Fancier Form
=======================
Building on the idea from the previous exercise, we will construct a fancier form with other fancier input types. Specifically, we will have a radio box, a dropdown box, and a checkbox in addition to the previous inputs.

Like the submit button, radio boxes and checkboxes are a variant of the `input` tag. Frustratingly, dropdown boxes are created with the `select` and `option` tags. Deal with it.

In trying to plan layout, it's worth noting that all input tags are inline by default (they stack horizontally).

Expected tags
-------------
* html
* head
* style
* body
* h1
* form
* label (3)
* input (5)
* select
* option (5)

General Notes
-------------
* The options for the dropdown box should be red, green, blue, fuchsia, and magenta, make sure the page starts with magenta selected
* The radio box lets you choose a single item out of a set. Make sure that your radio box lets you correctly choose either 'love music' or 'hate music' but not both.
